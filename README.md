# Selenium Test Automation

This project contains automated tests using Selenium WebDriver for testing web applications. The tests are written in C# and utilize the Selenium WebDriver framework to interact with the web elements and perform various actions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- Install C# and necessary dependencies.
- Install the Selenium WebDriver framework.
- Set up the web driver for the chosen browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome).

## Getting Started

To get started with running the tests, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Princy0/SeleniumTest`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd selenium-tests`
3. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
4. Configure the browser driver path in the test configuration file.
5. Run the tests: `npm test`

## Project Structure

The project has the following directory structure:

```
selenium-tests/
  ├── config/
  │   └── test.config.js
  ├── tests/
  │   ├── login.test.js
  │   └── registration.test.js
  ├── pages/
  │   ├── LoginPage.js
  │   └── RegistrationPage.js
  └── utils/
      └── helper.js
```

- `config/`: Contains the configuration file(s) for the tests.
- `tests/`: Contains the test scripts for different scenarios.
- `pages/`: Contains page object files that encapsulate the web elements and actions.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions or helper methods used in the tests.

## Writing Tests

To write new tests, follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new test script in the `tests/` directory.
2. Import the necessary page objects from the `pages/` directory.
3. Use the Selenium WebDriver methods to interact with the web elements and perform actions.
4. Implement assertions to verify the expected results.
5. Run the tests using the provided test runner or test framework.

## Continuous Integration

This project is set up for integration with a continuous integration (CI) system. The CI system can be configured to run the tests automatically on every code commit or on a predefined schedule. Refer to the CI documentation for instructions on how to set up and configure the integration.

## Reporting

Test results and any associated logs or screenshots are generated during the test execution. These artifacts can be found in the designated output directory. Additionally, you can integrate the tests with a reporting tool or framework to generate more detailed and comprehensive reports.
